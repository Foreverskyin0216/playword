## üì¶ Installation

Choose the package that best suits your needs.

### @playword/core

The `@playword/core` package provides the core features of PlayWord and can be used as **Node.js** modules.

It includes the following modules:

- **PlayWord**: Enables browser operations and validations using natural language inputs to interact with web pages.
- **Observer**: Mounts a monitoring interface on the browser to record and dry-run captured test steps.

```bash
# Install with any package manager you prefer
npm install @playword/core --save-dev
```

### @playword/cli

The `@playword/cli` package enables you to use the features of PlayWord directly through the command line.

For ease of use, I recommend running this package with `npx`.

```bash
# Run a PlayWord test
npx @playword/cli test --headed --verbose -b webkit

# Start the Observer
npx @playword/cli observe -b chromium -v
```

See [documentation](https://github.com/Foreverskyin0216/playword/tree/main/packages/cli) for usage examples and options.

## üìò Getting Started

PlayWord supports multiple AI services, including 
[Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/), 
[Google](https://ai.google.dev/), and [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com).
You can select the appropriate provider based on your requirements.

### OpenAI

There are two ways to provide the required API key to PlayWord:

<span>1.</span> Export the API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

<span>2.</span> Pass the API key as a parameter during initialization:

```ts
import { chromium } from 'playwright'

const browser = await chromium.launch()
const context = await browser.newContext()

const playword = new PlayWord(context, {
  aiOptions: {
    baseURL: 'https://...', // Custom API endpoint (If applicable)
    openAIApiKey: 'sk-...',
    model: 'gpt-4o' // If not specified, the default model is gpt-4o-mini.
  }
})
```

### Google

<span>1.</span> Export the API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="AI..."
```

<span>2.</span> Pass the API key as a parameter during initialization:

```ts
const playword = new PlayWord(context, {
  aiOptions: {
    googleApiKey: 'AI...',
    model: 'gemini-2.0-flash' // If not specified, the default model is gemini-2.0-flash-lite.
  }
})
```

### Anthropic

Since Anthropic does not offer its own embeddings model, integrating Anthropic requires an additional API key for embeddings.

Currently, PlayWord supports the following providers for embeddings:
- [VoyageAI (officially recommended by Anthropic)](https://www.voyageai.com/)
- OpenAI
- Google

<span>1.</span> Export API keys as environment variables:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-..."
export VOYAGEAI_API_KEY="pa-..."
```

<span>2.</span> Pass the API keys as parameters during initialization:

```ts
const playword = new PlayWord(context, {
  aiOptions: {
    anthropicApiKey: 'sk-...',
    voyageAIApiKey: 'pa-...',
    model: 'claude-3-7-sonnet-latest' // If not specified, the default model is claude-3-5-haiku-latest.
  }
})
```

### üìú PlayWord Options

| Name      | Type              | Default | Description                                                           |
| --------- | ----------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| aiOptions | object            | {}      | Configuration options for the AI instance.                            |
| debug     | boolean           | false   | Whether to enable debug mode.                                         |
| delay     | number            | 250     | Delay between each step in milliseconds.                              |
| record    | boolean \| string | false   | Whether to record actions performed and where to save the recordings. |

## üí¨ Communicate with Browser

In its basic usage, you can use the `say` method to interact with the page.

No need to worry about locating elements or performing interactions‚Äî**PlayWord handles all of that for you**.

```ts
await playword.say('Navigate to https://www.google.com')

await playword.say('Type "Hello, World!" in the search bar')

await playword.say('Press enter')
```

### ‚úÖ Assertion

PlayWord uses keywords to identify whether a step is an assertion.
This approach ensures more stable results compared to relying solely on AI judgment.

**Using PlayWord within Playwright Test**

```ts
import { PlayWord } from '@playword/core'
import { expect, test } from '@playwright/test'

test('get started link', async ({ context }) => {
  const playword = new PlayWord(context, { debug: true, record: 'recordings/getStartLink.json' })

  await playword.say('go to https://playwright.dev/')
  await playword.say('click the link "Get started"')

  expect(await playword.say('Verify if the installation heading is visible')).toBe(true)
})
```

The input starting with any of the following **case-insensitive** keywords will be recognized as an assertion:

- are
- assert
- assure
- can
- check
- compare
- confirm
- could
- did
- do
- does
- ensure
- expect
- guarantee
- has
- have
- is
- match
- satisfy
- shall
- should
- test
- then
- was
- were
- validate
- verify

### üñºÔ∏è Frame Handling

To interact with elements inside frames, simply instruct PlayWord to switch to the desired frame.

```ts
await playword.say('Go to https://iframetester.com')

await playword.say('Type "https://www.saucedemo.com" in the URL field')

await playword.say('Click the render button')

await playword.say('Switch to the frame with the url "https://www.saucedemo.com"')

// Perform actions inside the frame
await playword.say('Type standard_user into the username field')
```

### üîß Custom Variables

Hardcoding sensitive information in your test cases is not a good practice.
Instead, use custom variables with the syntax `{VARIABLE_NAME}` and define them in your environment settings.

```bash
# .env
USERNAME=standard_user
PASSWORD=secret_sauce
```

```ts
// Load environment variables
import 'dotenv/config'

// {USERNAME} and {PASSWORD} will be replaced with the values from the environment
await playword.say('Input {USERNAME} in the username field')
await playword.say('Input {PASSWORD} in the password field')
```

## üî¥ Recordings

PlayWord supports recording test executions and replaying them later for efficient and consistent testing.

```ts
// Save recordings to the default path (.playword/recordings.json)
const playword = new PlayWord(context, { record: true })

// Save recordings to a custom path (Must be `.json`)
const playword = new PlayWord(context, { record: 'spec/test-shopping-cart.json' })
```

If recordings are available, PlayWord prioritizes using them to execute tests, reducing the need to consume API tokens.

If a recorded action fails, PlayWord automatically retries it using AI.

### ‚ú® Using AI during Playback

To ensure PlayWord uses AI for specific steps during playback, start the input with `[AI]`.

```ts
await playword.say('[AI] click the "Login" button')

await playword.say('[AI] verify the URL matches "https://www.saucedemo.com/inventory.html"')
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Observer

The Observer module tracks user interactions on web pages and swiftly generates accurate test steps using AI.

![observer](https://i.ibb.co/3FGGnZL/observer.gif)

Upon activation, Playwright injects the Observer UI into every launched browser webpage.
As you manually interact with the page, the AI interprets your actions, generates corresponding test steps, and records action details.

### ‚ú® Observer Features
The Observer provides several controls to manage and interact with your test recordings:
- **Accept**: Add test steps to the recording. (Can also be invoked by pressing the `a` key)
- **Cancel**: Skip test steps without adding them to the recording. (Can also be invoked by pressing the `c` key)
- **Preview**: View the test steps recorded so far.
- **Clear**: Delete recorded test steps.
- **Dry Run**: Trial-run the recorded test steps. (Can press the `esc` key to stop the dry-run process)

And it captures various user interactions on the webpage as follows:
- **Click**: Triggered when an element on the webpage is clicked.
- **Hover**: Triggered when hovering over an element for more than three seconds
- **Input**: Triggered after entering content into an input field and then clicking the input field again.
- **Navigate**: Triggered when the page navigates to a new URL or is refreshed.
- **Select**: Triggered after selecting an option from a dropdown menu.

For complex actions and assertions that the Observer cannot directly record,
you can manually edit the step descriptions, enabling the AI to accurately capture your intentions.

### üìò Getting Started with Observer
To start using the Observer, create a PlayWord instance in **headed** mode,
pass it to the Observer, and initiate observation with Playwright.

```ts
import { chromium } from 'playwright'
import { Observer, PlayWord } from '@playword/core'

const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false /** Enable headed mode */ })
const context = await browser.newContext()

const playword = new PlayWord(context)
const observer = new Observer(playword, {
  delay: 500,
  recordPath: 'spec/test-login.json'
})

// Start the Observer
await observer.observe()

// Open a new page to observe
await context.newPage()
```

### üìú Observer Options

| Name       | Type   | Default                   | Description                                                         |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| delay      | number | 250                       | Delay between each step in milliseconds during the dry-run process. |
| recordPath | string | .playword/recordings.json | Where to save the recordings. (Must be `.json`)                     |

## üåü Why use PlayWord?

| Aspect         | Traditional Testing                                  | PlayWord                                                     |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Dev Experience | Locating elements is very frustrating.               | AI takes care of locating elements. Say goodbye to locators. |
| Dev Speed      | Time is needed for writing both test cases and code. | Test cases serve both as documentation and executable tests. |
| Maintainance   | High maintenance cost due to UI changes.             | AI-powered adaption to UI changes.                           |
| Learning Curve | Requires knowledge of testing frameworks and tools.  | Just use natural language to execute tests.                  |
